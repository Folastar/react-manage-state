# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are persisted in the browser's localStorage so they remain between sessions.

## Features:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed/incomplete
- Form validation to ensure both task name and description are filled
- Tasks are persisted using `localStorage`
- CSS styling to make the UI user-friendly

   cd todo-app
